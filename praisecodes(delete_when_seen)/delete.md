# What Did I Do?
Simple!!
<br/>
I simply changed the links you have in the app, in the navbar.jsx I noticed the use of "#" in the href section of links
so I corrected it by simply putting paths. Although not too sure of the "About" path, but I did change it though.
I didn't change others except "Home" and "About" because I couldn't find a .jsx file for them.
